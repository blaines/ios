CloudApp has quickly grown into a vital tool for thousands of Mac users. Together we can make it even better.

We want to open source as much of CloudApp as possible (without jeopardizing our business model â€” yes, we do have a business model).

We thought we would begin with our iPhone app. Our lab rat if you will. Although we are not sure as to how well this will work out we are excited to give it a try.

The iOS uploader for CloudApp is now an open source project you can contribute to.

###Opinionated Open Source

We believe good software is opinionated.

> Some people argue software should be agnostic. They say it's arrogant for developers to limit features or ignore feature requests. They say software should always be as flexible as possible.

> We think that's bullshit. The best software has a vision. The best software takes sides. When someone uses software, they're not just looking for features, they're looking for an approach. They're looking for a vision. Decide what your vision is and run with it.

Combining open source and [opinionated software](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php) is not easy but we believe it can be done.

###How does this work?

Our open source projects are available on [Github](http://github.com/cloudapp/) (we love Github). This makes it very easy for us to work together efficiently. We can track issues, manage forks and most importantly come up with new features and stories thanks to their newly re-vamped wikis.

We listen to the community and decide which features are necessary. Contributors can then jump on a story and implement it.

Because most open source software is not very pleasant to look at (we still believe in the concept) we will handle the UI and icon design for you.

###What's in it for you?

Some smaller benefits are:

- early access to new CloudApp features
- free CloudApp Pro subscriptions
- paid hosting for web apps written in Ruby or Node.js
- a star on our wall of fame (Who cares right?)

The real benefit is the code that will result from this experiment. Since it's open source you are more than welcome to use it in your own (commercial) apps.

We want to help third-party developers sell their commercial CloudApp backed applications (why wouldn't you want to add CloudApp support to your application if you can just use existing code).

###Contributing

All bugfixes are welcome. To submit a bugfix, fork this repo, add your fix, and send [cloudapp](http://github.com/cloudapp/ios/) a [pull request](http://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0/).

If you are interested in implementing new features please hold off until we set up the wiki for this repository.
